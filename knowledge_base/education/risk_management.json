  "content": "Risk management is essential for long-term trading success. Key principles: 1) Position sizing - Never risk more than 1-2% of total capital on a single trade. 2) Stop losses - Predetermined exit points to limit losses. 3) Risk-reward ratio - Aim for minimum 1:2 (risk 1 to gain 2). 4) Diversification - Don't concentrate all capital in one stock. 5) Emotional control - Don't let fear or greed drive decisions. 6) Backtesting - Test strategies on historical data before using real money. Remember: Preservation of capital is more important than profits. All trading involves risk of loss.",
